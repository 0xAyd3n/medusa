### Description:

**MEDUSA** is an Extensible and Modularised framework that automates processes and techniques practiced during the **dynamic analysis** **of Android Applications**.  

Some of the MEDUSA's features include:

- Tracing and instrumentation of API calls clustered according to their action (e.g. File System, IPC, Encryption)
- Tracing and instrumentation of Java and Native functions 
- Unpacking (effective for most of the weel known packers, including Qihoo, Secshell e.t.c.)
- Patching on the fly or statically (autoset the debugable flag)
- Triggering of various system events in order to initiate a reaction (e.g. send intents / notifications / events to the target app)
- Triggering of application's components (Activities, Services e.t.c.)

**Overview of the MEDUSA workflows (Presentation): [MEDUSA-Usage-workflows.pdf](https://github.com/Ch0pin/medusa/blob/master/MEDUSA-Usage-workflows.pdf)**


### Usage:

MEDUSA's functionality is divided in two basic python scripts: the **medusa.py** and the **apkutils.py** with the last to be more of a helping utility which automates processes like **setting a proxy server for the device**, **parcing the Anroid Manifest, starting/stoping activities and many more**. More specifically:

- **The medusa.py** 

  > This script is used to dynamically add or remove tracing of API calls during application's runtime. The tracing 'comes' in a form of modules, where each one of them 'specializes' in an abstract aspect. As an example, to trace the cryptographic procedures of the application (e.g.  fetch AES keys or the plaintext that will be encrypted), simply inject the AES module  and observer the output. 
  >
  > Indicatively some of the  functionalities which are implemented so far, include the following: 
  >
  > -  SSL pinning bypass
  > -  UI restriction bypass (e.g. Flag secure, button enable)
  > -  Class enumeration
  > -  Hook native functions
  > -  Monitoring of:
  >    -  Encryption process (keys, IVs, data to be encrypted)
  >    -  Intents
  >    -  Http communications
  >    -  Websockets
  >    -  Webview events
  >    -  File operations
  >    -  Database interactions
  >    -  Bluetooth operations
  >    -  Clipboard
  > -  Monitoring of API calls used by malware applications, such as:
  >    -  Spyware
  >    -  Click Fraud
  >    -  Toll Fraud
  >    -  Sms Fraud
  >

- **The apkutils.py** 

  > Given a **manifest or and apk file**, the specific script is able to perform the following functionalities:
  >
  > - Display the application's components and technical characteristics, including:
  >   - Activities
  >   - Services
  >   - Receivers
  >   - Permissions
  >   - Intent Filters 
  >   - Content providers
  > - Trace application functions 
  > - Trigger an activity, service or an intent
  > - Automate actions performed during dynamic analysis:
  >   - Change device proxy settings
  >   - Capture screenshots of the device
  >   - Install/Uninstall/kill an application
  > - Patch (set the debug flag to true) / Sign / Install

### Requirements:

See **requirements.txt** for python requirements as well as **frida** and **adb**. A rooted device or an emulator is highly recomended in order to use the framework's full capabilities.

### Modules:

A module (.med file) consists of three sections. 

    "Name": "foo_bar_dir/module_for_com_foo_bar",
    "Description": "What your module does ?",
    "Help": " How your module works ?",
    "Code": 

- The **'Name'** used in order to reference a module. Default name convention is lower case letters and underscores (e.g. **https_communications/ssl_unpining**)

- The **'Description'** where the usage of the module is described, e.g. *Description: Use this module to perform the following action* . 

- The **'Help'** where a more detailed information message or even a link to a website providing explanations about the module's usage is inserted

- The **Code** is where the javascript code should be inserted in order to hook a specific API call. 

  What follows is an example of the translation module:

For example the module bellow is used to cancel the killProcess, exit and finish of an application. The script itself is a json file using a .med suffix located under the **/medusa/modules/<category/** directory:

```js
{
    "Name": "helpers/cancel_system_exit",
    "Description": "Cancels application exit",
    "Help": "Hooks system.exit, activity.finish to cancel application's exit",
    "Code": "  
console.log(\"-----------Hooking SYSTEM EXIT----------------------\");

  var sysexit = Java.use(\"java.lang.System\");
  var activity = Java.use('android.app.Activity');
  var process = Java.use('android.os.Process');

  process.killProcess.implementation = function(pid){
    colorLog(\"[i] Canceling process kill with pid:\"+pid, {c: Color.Green});

  }
  sysexit.exit.overload(\"int\").implementation = function(var_0) {
    colorLog(\"[i] Canceling system exit\", {c: Color.Green});
  };

  activity.finish.overloads[0].implementation = function(){
    colorLog(\"[+] Canceling activity's finish\" ,{c: Color.Green});
    
  }
"
}


```



### Saving a Session (module recipies):

You can save a set of modules to a file in order to use them in another session. Export a set of used modules using the **export** command followed by the filename: 

**medusa>** export MyModuleRecipe.txt

Continue your session using the -r flag when starting MEDUSA: **./medusa.py** -r MyModuleRecipe.txt



### How To Create a Medusa Module:

A Medusa module is essentially a Frida script on steroids combined with multiple ready-made javascript functions that may enhance the final output. Assume that you found a super cool frida script online or you have many of them that you want to save in a classified manner:

1. **Remove Frida script's prologue / epilogue by changing it**

   **FROM:**

   ```
   	Java.perform(function() {
   
   		var hook = Java.use("com.foo.bar");
       
   		hook.function.implementation = function() {
   			console.log("Info: entered target method");		
       }
   
   	});  
   ```

   **TO:**

   ```
   		var hook = Java.use("com.foo.bar");
       
   		hook.function.implementation = function() {
   			console.log("Info: entered target method");		
       }
   ```

2. **Insert the modified code in the "code" segment of the following json object:**

   ```json
   {
       "Name": "foo_bar_dir/module_for_com_foo_bar",
       "Description": "What your module does ?",
       "Help": " How your module works ?",
       "Code": 
     "
       
       
   		var hook = Java.use(\"com.foo.bar\");
       
   		hook.function.implementation = function() {
   			console.log(\"Info\\n: entered target method\");		
       }
       
        
       
       "
   }
   ```

3. **Save the result to the /medusa/modules directory**

 if you think that your module can be classified in one's of Medusa's categories (e.g. http_communications), save your module as .med under the corresponding folder:

```
/medusa/modules/foo_bar_dir/module_for_com_foo_bar.med
```

 Or if you think your modulde can be classified to an already existing category, add it to the corresponding folder (e.g. /medusa/modules/http_communications)

That's all ... this module is now accessible via the medusa cli:

> medusa> show all
>
> medusa> use foo_bar_dir/module_for_com_foo_bar

4. **Contribute with a PR**

​	if you think that your module can be helpfull to other users, do a pull request

### ChangeLog:

**08/05/2021:**

- Added busybox support
- Ability to force native library loading

**07/02/2021:**

- **Medusa agent** was modified to include certificate set up functionality as well as a floating mod
- Burp Certificate installation
- Transparent proxy set up

**27/11/2020:** 

Feature added according to which the user can search for code snippets that may later imported to the current session. 

The code snippets are saved in the 'examples' directory and may be imported using the 'import' command, e.g.:

**medusa> import RegisterClass**

The code will be appended to the scratchpad and later get compiled to the final agent script.

- Spoof the Notification Listeners
- Hook notification events
- Fixes to dynamic code loading module
- Patch an apk by turning the debug flag to true



**04/11/2020:** More native hook options added:

- Hook by offset
- Hook by pattern



**16/09/2020:** READ/WRITE/SEARCH process memory

By issuing  **medusa> memops** **package_name** **module_name**, the framework can be used to perform read/write operations in the process memory.

```
