# **Description**:

**MEDUSA** is an Extensible and Modularized framework that automates processes and techniques practiced during the **dynamic analysis** **of Android Applications**.  

# **Installation**

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Requirements:** 

- Linux or macOS (currently medusa doesn't support windows)
- Python 3 (use the latest python release instead of the one shiped with MacOS to avoid issues with using libedit instead of GNU's readline)
- Rooted device 
- adb
- FRIDA server (running on the mobile device)

Medusa consists of two main scripts: **medusa.py** and **mango.py**:

# **Using medusa.py**

The main idea behind MEDUSA is to be able to add or remove hooks for Java or Native methods in a large scale while keeping the process simple and effective. MEDUSA has **more than** **90** modules which can be combined, each one of them dedicated to a set of tasks. Indicatively, some of these tasks include:

-  SSL pinning bypass
-  UI restriction bypass (e.g. Flag secure, button enable)
-  Class enumeration
-  Monitoring of:
   -  Encryption process (keys, IVs, data to be encrypted)
   -  Intents
   -  Http communications
   -  Websockets
   -  Webview events
   -  File operations
   -  Database interactions
   -  Bluetooth operations
   -  Clipboard
-  Monitoring of API calls used by malware applications, such as:
   -  Spyware
   -  Click Fraud
   -  Toll Fraud
   -  Sms Fraud
   
Furthermore you can intercept Java or Native methods that belong to 3rd party apps or create complex frida modules with just few simple commands. 

Please reffer to our [detailed wiki](https://github.com/Ch0pin/medusa/wiki) for usage details.

**Overview of the MEDUSA workflows (Presentation): [MEDUSA-Usage-workflows.pdf](https://github.com/Ch0pin/medusa/blob/master/MEDUSA-Usage-workflows.pdf)**

### Saving a Session (module recipies):

You can save a set of modules to a file in order to use them in another session. Export a set of used modules using the **export** command followed by the filename: 

**medusa>** export MyModuleRecipe.txt

Continue your session using the -r flag when starting MEDUSA: **./medusa.py** -r MyModuleRecipe.txt

### How To Create a Medusa Module:

A Medusa module is essentially a Frida script on steroids combined with multiple ready-made javascript functions that may enhance the final output. Assume that you found a super cool frida script online or you have many of them that you want to save in a classified manner:

1. **Remove Frida script's prologue / epilogue by changing it**

   **FROM:**

   ```
   	Java.perform(function() {
   
   		var hook = Java.use("com.foo.bar");
       
   		hook.function.implementation = function() {
   			console.log("Info: entered target method");		
      }
   
   	});  
   ```

   **TO:**

   ```
   		var hook = Java.use("com.foo.bar");
       
   		hook.function.implementation = function() {
   			console.log("Info: entered target method");		
      }
   ```

2. **Insert the modified code in the "code" segment of the following json object:** Do not forget to escape all 
quotes (`\"`).

   ```json
   {
       "Name": "foo_bar_dir/module_for_com_foo_bar",
       "Description": "What your module does ?",
       "Help": " How your module works ?",
       "Code": 
     "
       
       
   		var hook = Java.use(\"com.foo.bar\");
       
   		hook.function.implementation = function() {
   			console.log(\"Info\\n: entered target method\");		
       }
       
        
       
       "
   }
   ```

3. **Save the result to the /medusa/modules directory**

 if you think that your module can be classified in one's of Medusa's categories (e.g. http_communications), save your module as .med under the corresponding folder:

```
/medusa/modules/foo_bar_dir/module_for_com_foo_bar.med
```

 Or if you think your modulde can be classified to an already existing category, add it to the corresponding folder (e.g. /medusa/modules/http_communications)

That's all ... this module is now accessible via the medusa cli:

> medusa> show all
>
> medusa> use foo_bar_dir/module_for_com_foo_bar

4. **Contribute with a PR**

â€‹	if you think that your module can be helpfull to other users, do a pull request

# **Using mango.py**

After starting Mango, you can import an apk by simply running: 

**mango>** ***import** com.foo.bar.apk* 

You can also import an apk from the device:

**mango>** ***pull** com.foo.bar* 

and then:

**mango>** ***import** base.apk* 

After this **mango** will analyse the apk and save the analysis results to a SQLite database. It will also parse the manifest file to give you an overview of:

- The application's main components (activities, services, providers, receivers):

  **mango>** **show activities** // to display the activities (use -e to filter only the exported ones), similarly **show services** will display the services e.t.c. 

- The application's deeplinks and the corresponding activities that handles them:

  **mango>** **show deeplinks**

Mango wraps all the "borring tasks" in simple commands. For example you can install a burp certificate by simply running **installBurpCert**, set/reset a proxy (transparent or not) with **proxy set <IP:PORT> ** or you can patch the debuggable flag of the apk by simply running **patch com.foo.bar.apk**

**Here is the full list:**

    adb                         Start an interactive adb prompt.
    box                         Starts a busybox interactive shell.
    c                           Run a local shell command 
    cc                          Run a command using the default adb shell
    exit                        Exits the application.
    help                        Displays this text.
    
    import                      Imports an apk file for analysis and saves the results to the session's database 
    
    installBurpCert             Install the Burp certificate to the mobile device.
    jdwp                        Create a jdb session. Use it in combination with the tab key to see available packages. The app has to have the debuggable flag to true.
    
    notify                      Sends a notification to the device 
                                (Example: > notify 'Title' 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,....')
    
    patch                       Changes the debuggable flage of the AndroidManifest.xml to true for a given apk. 
    
    proxy                       Performs a proxy modification or reads a proxy setting (used for MITM). If adb runs as
                                root it can be used with the '-t' flag to set a transparent proxy.
                                (Example: > proxy set 192.168.1.2:8080 -t)
    
    pull                        Extracts an apk from the device and saves it as 'base.apk' in the working directory.
                                Use it in combination with the tab key to see available packages
                                (Example: > pull com.foo.bar)
    
    query                       Performs a raw query in the session db and returns the results as a list of tuples.
                                (Example: > query SELECT * FROM Application)
    
    screencap                   Captures the device screen and saves it as a png file in the current directory.
                                (Example: > screencap -o 'screen1.png')
    
    search                      Searches for a given string in the extracted components and strings.
                                (Example: search foobar)
    
    show                        Prints information about components of the loaded application or session. The currently available info includes: applications, activities, services, activityAlias, receivers, deeplinks, providers and intentFilters. Adding the '-e' flag will print only exported components. Additionaly 'database' prints the database structure of the session database, 'manifest' prints the manifest and 'info' prints general information about the loaded application  
    
    start                       Forces to start an activity of the loaded application. Use it in combination with the tab key to see the available activities. For non exported activities, the adb must run with root privileges.
    
    startsrv, stoprsrv          Forces to start or stop a service of the loaded application. Use it in combination with the tab key to see the available services. For non exported services, the adb must run with root privileges.
    
    trace                       trace the application's calls using Frida-trace
    uninstall, kill, spawn      Uninstalls, kills or starts an app in the device. Use it in combination with the tab key to see available packages.


# Using the translator script:
1. Replace the default google_trans_new.py of you google_trans_new python package with the one from the utils/google_trans_new.py
2. Import it with medusa>use helpers/tranlsator
3. Have fun
